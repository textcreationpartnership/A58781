                  <note>"It was, says the author, the outcome of a visit to London in 1679, when he enjoyed 'the opportunity of frequent converse with several substantial and judicious gentlemen concerned in the American plantations ...' The most valuable part of the work is a series of letters from the early settlers in New Jersey. 'The Model' was plagiarised by Samuel Smith in his 'History of New Jersey,' 1721, and is quoted by Bancroft; but James Grahame, author of the 'Rise and progress of the United States' (1827) first attached due importance to it ... Copies of original, which are very rare, are in the British Museum, the Edinburgh Advocate's Library, at GÃ¶ttingen, in Harvard College Library, and in the library of the New Jersey Historical Society, and two other are in private hands in America. In some copies a passage (p. 37) recommending religious freedom as an inducement to emigration is modified"--DNB.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its true, the firÅ¿t difficulty meets People in Planting there, is the cutting down Wood (Tho having Å¿ome Meadow intermixt already well covered with Hay, is a great eaÅ¿e) yet the trouble is compenÅ¿ed by the advantage, which the timber being cut down, yeelds, being good Oake, fit for Shipping and MaÅ¿ts; and alÅ¿o CheÅ¿mite. Walnut, Poplar, Cdar, AÅ¿h, Fir; And alÅ¿o, by the fertility of the Soyl, being cleared, which yeelds a vaÅ¿t increaÅ¿e not only of</hi> Indean <hi>Corn, which is a very wholÅ¿ome Food, but of</hi> EngliÅ¿h <hi>grain, as Wheat and Barley, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it uÅ¿ually yeelds betwixt the</hi> 20. <hi>and</hi> 30th. <hi>fold, and with far leÅ¿s labour (the timber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once removed) then in</hi> Britan. <hi>And to Å¿how the labour of the cutting down the Trees, and clearing the ground, is not Å¿o great as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103110:38"/> Å¿ome may Imagine; It is known by experience, that two men arriving there in</hi> September, <hi>or</hi> October, <hi>may clear as much ground, as uÅ¿ually brings by HarveÅ¿t following twenty Quarters, that is ahout</hi> 40. Scots Bolls <hi>of grain.</hi>

It is thought Olives would grow well there; and being Å¿tore of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103110:39"/> Mulberrie Trees, Silk-worms would do well there; for they were tryed in</hi> Virginia, <hi>and proved very well, if the lazineÅ¿s of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there being wholly Å¿et upon Tobacco, and the IntereÅ¿t of Merchants, who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid it might Å¿poil their Silk-Trade from the</hi> Straits, <hi>had not hindered.</hi>

               <hi>For Minerals, It is thought there are not wanting of Å¿everal Å¿orts, For there is an Iron-work already Å¿et up, where there is good Iron made; And alÅ¿o, there is diÅ¿covered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready abundance of Black-Lead.</hi>

               <hi>It is exceeding well furniÅ¿hed with Å¿afe, convenient Harbours, for Å¿hipping, which is of great advantage; and affords already for Exportation, great plenty of HorÅ¿es, and alÅ¿o Beef, Pork, PipÅ¿taves, Bread, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, White, Barley, Rye,</hi> Indian <hi>Corn, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and CheeÅ¿e, which they export for</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes, Jamaica, Mevis, <hi>and other adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> IÅ¿lands; <hi>As alÅ¿o to</hi> Portugal, Spain, <hi>and the</hi> Canaryes, <hi>their</hi> Whale Oyl, <hi>and</hi> Whale-Fins, Beaver, Mink, Racon, <hi>and</hi> Martine-skins <hi>(which this Countrey pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces) they tranÅ¿port for</hi> England.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> Indian Natives <hi>in this Countrey are but few, comparative to the Neighbouring Collony; And theÅ¿e that are there, are Å¿o far from being Formidable, and injurious to the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Inhabitants, that they are really Å¿erviceable and advantagious to them, not only in hunting, and taking the Deer, and all other wild Creatures, and catching of FiÅ¿h, and Fowl fit for food, in their Å¿eaÅ¿ons; But in the killing and deÅ¿troying of Bears, Wolves, Foxes, and other Vermine, whoÅ¿e Skins and Furs they bring the</hi> EngliÅ¿h, <hi>and Å¿ell them at leÅ¿s price, then the value of the time,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103110:40"/> that people muÅ¿t Å¿pend to take them. Like as, that this Collony may be founded in JuÅ¿tice, and without any thing of OppreÅ¿Å¿ion, as all that is already Planted; is is truly PurchaÅ¿ed from the</hi> Indians, <hi>Å¿o there is a great deal more of the Province cleared by their conÅ¿ent; and all is intended by paction with them to be obtained; Å¿o that whoever PurchaÅ¿e; or Plant under the Proprietors; Å¿hal be fred of that incumbrance; and if there were any hazard from the</hi> Indians <hi>as really there is none; yet this Province could hardly be in any danger; In reÅ¿pect that to the</hi> North, <hi>upon the</hi> Main-Land; <hi>from whence the hazard; if any muÅ¿t come; the Province of</hi> New-York <hi>comes betwixt it and them, and</hi> 20. miles <hi>and more, above upon</hi> HudÅ¿ons <hi>River, there is a Fort called</hi> New-Albany.</p>

We have one thing more particular to us, which the other want alÅ¿o: which is vaÅ¿t OyÅ¿ters banks, which is ConÅ¿tant freÅ¿h Victuals during the winter to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h</hi> as well as <hi>Indians;</hi> of theÅ¿e there are many all along our CoaÅ¿ts from that Sea as high as againÅ¿t <hi>New York,</hi> whence they come to fetch them, Å¿o we are Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Å¿alt fiÅ¿h at our doors, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a tydes paÅ¿Å¿age, and freÅ¿h FiÅ¿h in aboundance in every little brook, as <hi>Pearch, Trout, Ells, &amp;c.</hi> which we catch at our doors.

The people are general a Å¿ober profeÅ¿Å¿ing people, WiÅ¿e in their Generation, Courtious in their Behaviour, and ReÅ¿pectful to us in Office among them.

I bleÅ¿s the LORD, I never had better health nor my Family, my Daughters are very well improved in that reÅ¿pect, and tell me, they would not change their place for <hi>George Yeard,</hi> nor would I; People here are generally Å¿ettled, where the tyde reaches, and althoughs this is good Land and well Timbered and plentifully Å¿upplied with Salt-MariÅ¿h, yet there is much better Land up higher on the River, where they may go up with Å¿mall boats, where many now are Å¿ettling, there's extraordinary Land, freÅ¿h Meadows overflowed in the Winter time, that produces multitudes of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Corns, and its believed will end are 20, 30, or 50, years flowing without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromiÅ¿Å¿ion, and not decay; Å¿uch Land there is at <hi>Sops</hi> on <hi>HudÅ¿ons River,</hi> which hath born Winter Corn about 20. years without help, and is as good as at firÅ¿t, and better. <hi>William Penn</hi> took a view of the Land this laÅ¿t moneth, when here,

We have Å¿tore of Clamms eÅ¿teemed much better then OyÅ¿ters; one <hi>FeÅ¿tivals</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> feaÅ¿t with them, there are Shallops, but in no great plentie.

                        <p>I Have taken up a part of my Land, 9. miles from <hi>Amboy,</hi> and 4. miles from <hi>PiÅ¿cataway,</hi> and as far from the neareÅ¿t part of <hi>Rariton,</hi> on a Brook Å¿ide, where there are exceeding great plains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Timber, there is excellent Gunning for Dear and Turkies, of which there is great plenty, and eaÅ¿ily Å¿hot. But I reÅ¿olve to Å¿ee a place called <hi>Bernagate,</hi> which is 60. or 70. miles from this, on the SouthermoÅ¿t place of the Province, where there is a good River and Harbour, the beÅ¿t FiÅ¿hing and Gunning in any place in <hi>America</hi> 30. or 40. miles from any Plantation. The Indians here are nothing to be feared, the Place being as peaceable as any where elÅ¿e; I had occaÅ¿ion to travel through <hi>Long-IÅ¿land.</hi> and <hi>Stallen IÅ¿land,</hi> and for many miles found as many towns and plantations in the way, as in any Å¿o much Land in <hi>Louthean,</hi> there are no Bears
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103110:101"/> nor Ravinous BeaÅ¿ts but Wolves, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be feared, neither are the Countrey People afraid to be among them all night, in Å¿o much as I oft-times going wrong, and lying out all night, and hearing their yells about me, and telling that I was afraid of them, the Countrey People laught at it; neither are the Snakes any thing to be noticed, for nothing can come near them, but they give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ratling of their tail, Å¿o that People may either kill them, or go by them as they pleaÅ¿e. Oxen are Å¿o well taught that they go Å¿ometimes in a Plough, or Cart, without HorÅ¿e, or without a Gade-man; HorÅ¿es and Cattel are as cheap as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> conÅ¿idering their goodneÅ¿s and the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Money; All Å¿orts of <hi>Scots</hi> goods Å¿ells well here, ye will be adviÅ¿ed with the next OccaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what goods Å¿ells beÅ¿t in this place. I have great reaÅ¿on to thank GOD, that I am in a place which abundantly anÅ¿wers any thing I expected; The Air is healthful, and the Soil fruitful; the <hi>Indian</hi> Corn yeelds commonly 2. or 3. hundred fold, Oats 20. fold, as I am informed; the <hi>Indian</hi> Corn is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent grain, I have eat it and likes it very well in Pottage and Bread; there are Å¿everal reaÅ¿onable good towns in this Province, moÅ¿t of them hath more then eighty Families; there is no poor perÅ¿ons here, but all are half idle in reÅ¿pect of what they work with you. Flax twice heckled, Å¿old at 9. <hi> d. per pound,</hi> Wool is very cheap, only work is dear; the Liquor we moÅ¿t uÅ¿e is Sider; we have great Å¿tore of Fruit. In many places untaken up there are many plains and not a tree; I have never Å¿ince laÅ¿t part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had any Å¿ickneÅ¿s to keep me from one Dyet, for which I render thanks to GOD.

But being this DiÅ¿abled, and not being able to ply out her Voyage to this place (where Å¿he ought to have landed us, we was neceÅ¿Å¿itat to travel from thence by Land to this place, being upwards of <hi>200.

There are many places upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers yet untaken, and Å¿ome very near this place alÅ¿o, which is intended to be the <hi>Metrapolis</hi> of this Province; But it is generally Å¿andy barren land, and the beÅ¿t

If I deÅ¿ign to come home, which we can do at good profite. Now for a general deÅ¿cription of this Countrey, it is a fine place for thoÅ¿e who have a good Å¿tock, to lay out upon a Å¿tock of Cattel of all Å¿orts, which do greatly multiply here in a Å¿hort time, and are Å¿old at great rates, and may Å¿oon increaÅ¿e a Å¿tock greatly; or it is a good Countrey for an InduÅ¿trious Frugal Man, that deÅ¿ignes to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Husbandries cloÅ¿lie; providing he bring but Å¿ome little Å¿tock to Å¿tock a Plantation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; or it is very good for TradÅ¿men, as good Carpenters, Smiths, Tailors, &amp;c. who will get large wages a day. But it is not a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for idle Å¿luggiÅ¿h People; or thoÅ¿e who cannot Å¿ome times put too their hands, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Servants. It is a place that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces many fine Fruits, and PhyÅ¿ick Herbs; The Woods are Å¿tored with wild Deers, Conies, Woulves, Boars, Racouns, Å¿ome Bavers, and Å¿everal other BeaÅ¿ts, which have fine Furrs. There is alÅ¿o abundance of Fowls, and FiÅ¿h, and Water Fowl for the killing. The Timber
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103110:127"/> are moÅ¿tly Oak of all Å¿orts, Walnut, CheÅ¿nut, whereof there are great abundance where I have planted, tho they beÅ¿carce Å¿o bigg as theÅ¿e that comes to <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet large as pleaÅ¿ant. Strawberries grow very thick upon the ground amongÅ¿t the Trees; Å¿o that Å¿ome places of the Woods are in Summer as it were covered with a red cloath. As I am certainly informed, Fruit Trees advance at a great rate in this place, for a Man may have an Orchard within a few years after the Planting, that may yeeld him a great quantitie of Cydar, which is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t of their drink in this Province, even amongÅ¿t the meaneÅ¿t of the Planters; So that this Countrey if well improved, may make a fine place; for Nature has been defficient in nothing to it, either for pleaÅ¿ure or fruitfulneÅ¿s of the Soyl; So that a man being once Å¿ettled two or three years in it, and having Corn, Cattle, and all things neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the uÅ¿e of man within himÅ¿elf.

And having thus abruptly come away, when I came here, I deÅ¿igned not to return till I took Å¿ome tryal of the Countrey, that at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn I might be the more able to give an true accompt thereof.
