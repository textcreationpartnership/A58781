                  <note>"It was, says the author, the outcome of a visit to London in 1679, when he enjoyed 'the opportunity of frequent converse with several substantial and judicious gentlemen concerned in the American plantations ...' The most valuable part of the work is a series of letters from the early settlers in New Jersey. 'The Model' was plagiarised by Samuel Smith in his 'History of New Jersey,' 1721, and is quoted by Bancroft; but James Grahame, author of the 'Rise and progress of the United States' (1827) first attached due importance to it ... Copies of original, which are very rare, are in the British Museum, the Edinburgh Advocate's Library, at Göttingen, in Harvard College Library, and in the library of the New Jersey Historical Society, and two other are in private hands in America. In some copies a passage (p. 37) recommending religious freedom as an inducement to emigration is modified"--DNB.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS your Lordſhips concern in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> makes it appear to all intelligent perſons, that it is a <hi>Nationall intereſt</hi> to advance in generall the deſign of a Plantation, hence to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica;</hi> ſo that in particular, <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103110:3"/> is the moſt proper place; ſeeing your Lordſhips have choſen it among all the other parts of that continent, to ſettle your intereſt there; Yet my <hi>Lords,</hi> there are (to our ſhame) a parcell of people, who whether out of Ignorance or Malice, I cannot well determine, decry the deſign; I believe they have a ſhare of both, and thereby weakens not a little the hands of a number of well meaning people, who would gladly promot the ſame effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualy, were they not impoſed upon by the falſe rumours, induſtriouſly ſpread abroad to ſtiffle any ſuch inclinations.</p>
            <p>I have been adviſed to conſent to the publiſhing of the following ſheets, at firſt collected, only for my own divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and more clear information in the affair; As what may tend ſome what to prevent any fooliſh miſrepreſentation when by the perusall of the accompts, from thence the leaſt jealouſie is removed of any cheat in the thing it ſelf, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious a Character of the place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſo many different hands.</p>
            <p>I have had too many demonſtrations, of your Lordſhips favour, to fear your diſpleaſure upon accompt of my preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:103110:3"/> to ſend the ſame abroad under your <hi>Patrociny;</hi> yea, I dare further adventure, without the leaſt apprehenſion of your diſſatisfaction with me upon that head, to mind your Lordſhips that as you have laid the foundation of this deſign, as to any concern of this Countrey, in that place; ſo it is expected your Lordſhips will continue to encourage the ſame: in proceſs of time your Lordſhips may render your Names and Families as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in <hi>America</hi> as they are in <hi>Europ.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Having at</hi> London <hi>in the year</hi> 1679, <hi>the opportunity of frequent converſe with ſeveral
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103110:5"/> Subſtantial and Judicious Gentlemen, concerned in the</hi> American Plantations, <hi>I had thereby the opportunity of underſtanding throughly the great advantage redounding to that City, from</hi> Undertakings of this nature, <hi>and rational grounds of Conjecture,</hi> That their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with that place of the World, hath been one of the greateſt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that Trade, they have for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years enjoyed, which hath rendered it now one of the moſt conſiderable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Europe;</hi> the Cuſtomes thereof which in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, were farmed at <hi>Fifty thouſand pounds,</hi> paying now in to the Exchequer, near <hi>ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds</hi> yearly, which great Improvement may be much attribute to their Trade with <hi>America,</hi> brought now in a great manner to Perfection, which at that time was but in its Infancy.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103110:39"/> Mulberrie Trees, Silk-worms would do well there; for they were tryed in</hi> Virginia, <hi>and proved very well, if the lazineſs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there being wholly ſet upon Tobacco, and the Intereſt of Merchants, who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid it might ſpoil their Silk-Trade from the</hi> Straits, <hi>had not hindered.</hi>

               <hi>The</hi> Indian Natives <hi>in this Countrey are but few, comparative to the Neighbouring Collony; And theſe that are there, are ſo far from being Formidable, and injurious to the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Inhabitants, that they are really ſerviceable and advantagious to them, not only in hunting, and taking the Deer, and all other wild Creatures, and catching of Fiſh, and Fowl fit for food, in their ſeaſons; But in the killing and deſtroying of Bears, Wolves, Foxes, and other Vermine, whoſe Skins and Furs they bring the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and ſell them at leſs price, then the value of the time,

                     <p>TO be as particular in my return, were but thy due, yet I cannot promiſe ſo much, However I may give thee ſome general account of the Province, and of our ſatisfaction with our preſent Lot, the ſhort time I have experienced this.</p>
                     <p>But to give thee alſo, as thou deſires a Character of <hi>Penſalvania</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Jerſey;</hi> that will be a task I muſt be excuſed to undertake, leaſt I give offence, or at leaſt bring me under cenſure as partial: Were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103110:78"/> I not concerned in any of the Provinces I might ſatisfie thy curioſitie: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chieflie intereſted in this, I'le be very cautious medling with my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours more then here, one with another, ſo I may uſe my freedom with my Neighbours which they take not ill, but writ that they may take otherwayes; They lye ſo near adjacent, that they may be ſaid in a ſence, to be but one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; And whats ſaid for one in General may ſerve for all: I have been at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtoun,</hi> and at <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> as far as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> which lyes about 20, miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Burlingtoun:</hi> That journey by Land gave me ſome view of all the Provinces, and made me now conſiderably to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate this of <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey;</hi> having ſome Conveniences eſteemed be me, which the others are not ſo plentifully furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal, <hi>viz.</hi> freſh and ſalt Meadows, which now are very valuable and no man here will take up a Tract of Land without them; being the ſupport of their flocks in Winter, which other parts muſt ſupplie be ſtore, and taking more care for Engliſh Graſs; But know where ſalt Marisſhes are not; there is no <hi>Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos,</hi>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:103110:79"/> and that manner of Land, the more health, and this was often anſwered me, when I have been making compariſons; I muſt tell thee, their Character in Print by all that reads it, here is ſaid to be modeſt, and much more might have been ſaid in its Commendation. We have one thing more particular to us, which the other want alſo: which is vaſt Oyſters banks, which is Conſtant freſh Victuals during the winter to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> as well as <hi>Indians;</hi> of theſe there are many all along our Coaſts from that Sea as high as againſt <hi>New York,</hi> whence they come to fetch them, ſo we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with ſalt fiſh at our doors, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a tydes paſſage, and freſh Fiſh in aboundance in every little brook, as <hi>Pearch, Trout, Ells, &amp;c.</hi> which we catch at our doors. Proviſions here are very plentiful, and people generally well ſtockt with Cattle: <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtoun</hi> hath hitherto been their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, Few or no Trading-Men being here in this Province, I believe it hath been very unhappily heretofore under an ill managed Government, and moſt of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103110:79"/> the people who are ſuch, who have been invited from the adjacent Collonies by that goodneſs of its Soill, and convenient Scituation, at <hi>Amboy</hi> we are now build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſmall houſes of 30. foot long, and 18. foot breadth, fitting to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Work-men, and ſuch who will go and build larger, the ſtones lye exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well and good up that <hi>Rariton River</hi> a Tydes paſſage, and <hi>Oyſter-ſhells</hi> upon the point to make lyme withall, which will wonderfully accommodat us in building good houſes cheap, warm for Winter, cool for Summer, and durable, covering for houſes are Shingles, Oak, Cheſnut and Cedar, we have plentiful here of all, the laſt endures a mans age if he live to be old; There is 5. or 6.

Tuns come before our doors, throughout this Town is good <hi>Engliſh</hi> graſs and (bears) a very good burthen; we cannot call our habitation ſolitarie, for what with the publict employ I have little leſs companie at my houſe dayly then I had in <hi>George Yeard,</hi> although not ſo many paſs by my doors. The people are general a ſober profeſſing people, Wiſe in their Generation, Courtious in their Behaviour, and Reſpectful to us in Office among them. As for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Air, it is wonderfully ſcituated to the <hi>Humours of Mankind,</hi> the wind and weather rarely holding in one point, or one kind for ten dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It is a rare thing for a Veſſel to be wind-bound for a week together, the wind ſeldom holding in a point more then 48. hours, &amp; in a ſhort time we have weet and dry, warm and cold weather, which changes we often deſire in <hi>England</hi> and look for before they come; Yet this Variation creats not cold, nor have we the tenth part of the cold as we have in <hi>England;</hi> I never had any ſince I came,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103110:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> and in the midſt of Winter, and Froſts could endure it with leſs cloaths then in <hi>England,</hi> for generally I go with that ſame Cloaths I uſe to wear in Summer with you, but warm cloaths hurt not. I bleſs the LORD, I never had better health nor my Family, my Daughters are very well improved in that reſpect, and tell me, they would not change their place for <hi>George Yeard,</hi> nor would I; People here are generally ſettled, where the tyde reaches, and althoughs this is good Land and well Timbered and plentifully ſupplied with Salt-Mariſh, yet there is much better Land up higher on the River, where they may go up with ſmall boats, where many now are ſettling, there's extraordinary Land, freſh Meadows overflowed in the Winter time, that produces multitudes of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Corns, and its believed will end are 20, 30, or 50, years flowing without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromiſſion, and not decay; ſuch Land there is at <hi>Sops</hi> on <hi>Hudſons River,</hi> which hath born Winter Corn about 20. years without help, and is as good as at firſt, and better. <hi>William Penn</hi> took a view of the Land this laſt moneth, when here,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103110:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſaid, he had never ſeen ſuch before in his life: All the <hi>Engliſh Merchants,</hi> and many of the <hi>Dutch</hi> have taken, and are deſirous to take up Plantations with us. Our Countrey here called <hi>Berghen</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> at a town called <hi>Newark</hi> 7. or 8. miles hence is made great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Syder, exceeding any we can have from <hi>New-England,</hi> or <hi>Rood-Iſland,</hi> or <hi>Long-Iſland;</hi> I hope to make 20. or 30. Barrels out of our Orchard next year, as they have done who had it before me, for that, it muſt be as providence ordered: Upon our view and ſurvey of <hi>Amboy-point</hi> we find extraordinary well ſcituate for a great Town or City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yound expectation, at low water round about the point are Oyſters; There are Oyſters of two kinds, ſmall as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and others two or three morſells, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good for roaſting and ſtewing; The people ſay our Oyſters are good and in ſeaſon all Summer; The firſt of the third Moneth I eat of them at <hi>Amboy</hi> very good; The point is good lively Land, 10. ſome places 20. foot above the water mark, About it are ſeveral Coves with ſmall Coaſts may lay up Veſſels as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103110:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> in a decke, beſides great Ships of any burthen, may all ryde before the town Land-loked againſt all winds: There <hi>Rariton-River</hi> runs up, or rather down 50 (far larger,) ſome ſay 100. mylles for ſmall boats. I ſaw ſeveral vines upon the point, which produces, as they ſay, good grapes in their Seaſon, this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is very full of them, but being no preſent mother of profite, few regard them more then to pick them as they lay in their way when they are rype. We have ſtore of Clamms eſteemed much better then Oyſters; one <hi>Feſtivals</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> feaſt with them, there are Shallops, but in no great plentie. Fiſh we have great ſtore, as our relation ſet forth, but they are very good when catcht. (as the proverb is) I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Barrels by me now, which are good for our Table, and for Sale. I brought a Sea-Net over with me which may turn to good account. Sea-Nets are good Merchandiſe here, mine coſt me about 4. or 5. <hi>lib.</hi> and can have 20. <hi>lib.</hi> for it if I would ſell it now; I may writ of many ſuch matters in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which may invite perſons here,

                        <p>I Have taken up a part of my Land, 9. miles from <hi>Amboy,</hi> and 4. miles from <hi>Piſcataway,</hi> and as far from the neareſt part of <hi>Rariton,</hi> on a Brook ſide, where there are exceeding great plains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Timber, there is excellent Gunning for Dear and Turkies, of which there is great plenty, and eaſily ſhot. But I reſolve to ſee a place called <hi>Bernagate,</hi> which is 60. or 70. miles from this, on the Southermoſt place of the Province, where there is a good River and Harbour, the beſt Fiſhing and Gunning in any place in <hi>America</hi> 30. or 40. miles from any Plantation. The Indians here are nothing to be feared, the Place being as peaceable as any where elſe; I had occaſion to travel through <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> and <hi>Stallen Iſland,</hi> and for many miles found as many towns and plantations in the way, as in any ſo much Land in <hi>Louthean,</hi> there are no Bears

Oxen are ſo well taught that they go ſometimes in a Plough, or Cart, without Horſe, or without a Gade-man; Horſes and Cattel are as cheap as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> conſidering their goodneſs and the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Money; All ſorts of <hi>Scots</hi> goods ſells well here, ye will be adviſed with the next Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what goods ſells beſt in this place.

Flax twice heckled, ſold at 9. <hi> d. per pound,</hi> Wool is very cheap, only work is dear; the Liquor we moſt uſe is Sider; we have great ſtore of Fruit. In many places untaken up there are many plains and not a tree; I have never ſince laſt part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had any ſickneſs to keep me from one Dyet, for which I render thanks to GOD.

               <p>NOw Sir, does not the peruſal of thir Letters, obliege you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no deceit in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove written diſcription of the place, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you find the ſame Homollogat by ſo many different perſons; the <hi>Hollograph</hi> of moſt of them have been peruſed by many perſons in this City, and are to be ſeen by any inquiſitive thereanent at <hi>Captain Hamiltouns</hi> Lodging at the Sign of the Ship, for their more ſatisfaction of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>But tho you appear to be convinced, that <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey</hi> is in it ſelf a very deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able place, and conſequently upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conſiderations a very proper ſeat
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103110:109"/> for a Collony; From this yet I have ground to conjecture from ſome tacit hints and inſinuations in yours, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Weſt-Jerſey, Penſilvania,</hi> and in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner <hi>Carolina,</hi> are more ſoutherly, therefore <hi>you think</hi> there is ſome ground to believe they may have the advantage of the Soyl, ſeing you oblidge me to tell you freely my opinion in this affair, I will be plain with you; the two firſt lying, the one upon the one ſide of the River of <hi>Delawar,</hi> the other upon the other ſide thereof, may have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves other advantages; but I cannot be ſo blind, when I notice the <hi>Mapp,</hi> as not to diſcover too palpable an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie to be paſt over; wherewith both the ſaid Countries are much ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; <hi>to wit.</hi> the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> lying upon the mouth of the River, which doth ſo abſolutly command the River, <hi>that whoſoever is maſter thereof, may if they pleaſe, lay what impoſition they think fit upon both the ſaid Countries; ſeeing if any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould fall betwixt the Town of Newcaſtle,</hi> and the Poſſeſſors, or Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of theſe two Provinces, they may make themſelves very quickly Maſters
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103110:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> of them, by impoſing what conditions they think fit upon them; ſeeing no. Ship can either conveniently go up or down the ſaid River of <hi>Delawar,</hi> but by allowance of any <hi>Fort,</hi> built upon the ſaid Town of <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> Whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion others may have of this as a matter of no great import, I have theſe ſentiments of the apparent inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof, as after perceiving it never to be any more ſo much concerned, as to make farther inquiry after theſe places ſeeing in my apprehenſion, no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be propoſed there could compenſe that ſo viſible conveniency.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Carolina,</hi> I confeſs it is nothing ſtrange that any perſon who hath read <hi>Ogibies</hi> deſcription thereof in his <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Wilſons</hi> in his Treatiſe thereanent; Judge it in a maner a <hi>Terreſtiral Paradiſe,</hi> but notwithſtanding of all this, err you paſs any judgement upon my choiſing rather <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> then <hi>Carolina</hi> for the ſeat of a Collony from this, allow me to give my Reaſons why I do prefer the one to the other.</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:103110:110"/>
               <p>We lye here in 56. Degrees of <hi>Northren Latitude, Jerſey</hi> in 41. <hi>Carolina</hi> in 31. it is very obvious to any underſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that our removall to 41. is more probably contributive for our health, then to 31, being ten degrees hotter; and conſequently more dangerous, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver opinion others may have of this, I judge it a matter of no ſmal conſequence, health being very much preferrable to all other things whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But further, our acceſs to <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey</hi> is very patent, no apparent obſtruction in the way, whereas the coaſt of <hi>Carolina</hi> is the moſt dangerous in all <hi>America,</hi> there being a bank of ſand lying all along the ſame for 200. Leags and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſo that the entry to any part thereof is altogether hazardous, we have too ſad a proof of the truth of this, by the Shipwrack of the <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Air,</hi> upon that bank this laſt Harveſt, in which were loſt upwards of 60. peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>Experience alſo teacheth that the Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> is far move ſuitable to our <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> then that of <hi>Carolina;</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:103110:110"/> You find in all the Letters come from <hi>Jerſey,</hi> this one particular ſpecially mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That it is a very healthfull Air;</hi> no complaints of ſickneſs there, whereas in the few Letters from our Countrey men ſettled in <hi>Carolina;</hi> You have an accompt of the <hi>death of the greateſt part who went hence to that place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one further conſideration ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidging me altogether, to cloſe my Ears and Eyes againſt <hi>Carolina;</hi> whatever ſpecious pretences may flie abroad in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours thereof, and be received by ſuch who are not concerned, to enquire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to <hi>hear-ſay,</hi> and that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the model of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then which nothing can be more diſcouraging to any having the ſence of a rational Man, or Spirit of a Gentleman. The Offices of Honour and Truſt, ſuch, as <hi>Chancellour, Theſaurer, Admiral, Secretar, &amp;c.</hi> are all Heretably annexed to the Proprietors; by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Government, ſo that let a Gentleman deſerve never ſo well, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eminent his parts may be, he muſt in the firſt place purchaſe a property, err he can attain to any of theſe places of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103110:111"/> Truſt, or Honor; whereas if you have ſo much Money as to make this purchaſe, you may then come to theſe preferments though you were the <hi>arrenteſt Block head in nature!</hi> Money here makes you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Preferment, which neither Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Merit, nor parts can do! Can there be a greater diſcouragement to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> than to go ſubject himſelf to a Government where he ſees himſelf debarred of any Truſt or Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how ever deſerving he may be? unleſs he hath money in a manner to buy it with. Both in this <hi>Kingdom</hi> and our <hi>Neighbour Nations,</hi> we ſee mean Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have by their Parts and Merit raiſed themſelves to places of the higheſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in the Kingdoms, and have diſcharged that Truſt conferred upon them with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Applauſe;</hi> So that when I have this conſideration before my Eyes, I muſt conclude any who ſubjects themſelves to that <hi>model of Government,</hi> are either ignorant of the Conſtitutions thereof, or of very mean Spirits, to ſettle themſelves in a place where Vertue nor Merit can neither raiſe them, nor their Poſterity!</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:103110:111"/>
               <p>Let me add another Ground of my diſſatisfaction with the <hi>Model of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and you may judge whether the ſame be reaſonable or not; There are <hi>eight Proprietors by their Conſtitutions,</hi> it appears clear to me, that they are ſo many <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> ſeing by one expreſs <hi>Article</hi> of their <hi>Fundamental Conſtitutions,</hi> it is declared, <hi>That the Proprietors are no waves ſubject to Law, in ſo far as to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by any Judicatur there;</hi> So that be their Actings never ſo Illegal, or unjuſt; if any theſe <hi>eight Proprietors</hi> ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Murders, or Rapes, or any other Act of Oppreſſion, they cannot be challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon accompt thereof in any <hi>Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> in <hi>Carolina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe being ſo matterial Objections, I need not add the apparent hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next Neighbour to the <hi>Spainard,</hi> whoſe intereſt it is to ruine any ſetling at <hi>Port Royal;</hi> how little probability there is, that any going at firſt from this can be of ſufficient ſtrength to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt their deſigns, that in caſe of any aſſault from that airth; their nixt and only neighbour, <hi>Charles-toun,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:103110:112"/> could not give that help, which were requiſit in ſuch an exigent, either againſt the <hi>Spainards</hi> their nixt neighbours, at <hi>St. Auguſtines</hi> Fort, or the <hi>Natives,</hi> if they ſhould become <hi>quarrelſome Neighbors;</hi> But from the complext conſideration of all together, I muſt diveſt my ſelf of my reaſon, or I judge <hi>Carolina</hi> a proper ſeat to ſettle my ſelf in.</p>
               <p>But tho you be oblidged to grant, that <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> may be the moſt deſirable ſpott of ground upon the continent of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> for ſuch a deſign, upon the above written conſiderations; yet I do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend you may incline to think that <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bago, St. Luce, St. Vincent,</hi> or ſome of theſe Iſlands were yet more proper as affoording at firſt view greater ground of expecting ſuitable returns to the apparent expenſe &amp; hazards of ſuch a undertaking; witneſs the great riches of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> by the improvment of a Trade, from that place all <hi>Europe</hi> over.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I muſt confeſs, Sir, that there may be greater improvements of ſuch Iſlands as to trade, when they do come to that length of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to produce <hi>Suggars, Cotton,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103110:112"/> Indigo, &amp;c.</hi> But let me alſo tell you, there is a certain proſpect of far greater &amp; more imminent hazards in ſettling there, then in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey.</hi> It is certainly obvious to the meaneſt capacities what hardſhips theſe muſt be oblidged to lay their compt to meet with who would interpriſe ſuch a deſign, not only from the wants thy might be expoſed to throw lake of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar ſupplies, wherewith they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the conveniencie of being furniſhed. but from other hazards and difficulties. It is not ſmall ſtock could ſet ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on foot, neither can it be expected that ſuch who would ingadge in ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking from this place could in many years attain to that ſtrength, which were neceſſarily requiſite for defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves even againſt the Piracy of a <hi>Bucca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> or two, far leſs againſt the invaſions or aſſaults of forraign States and Princes.</p>
               <p>As for my own part I muſt confeſs, I am not very anxious of great Riches, as the reſult of this undertaking, but to carry my Wife and Children with me; I am bound the beſt I can to look to their Accommodation; when I land in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:103110:113"/> there are Lodgings, and all other neceſſars to be had for money, till by our own induſtry in Labouring the Ground, we provide for our ſelves, which could not be expected in one of theſe Iſlands; If I have a Countrey no worſe than the <hi>South of France,</hi> with theſe Conveniencies above narrated, I deſire no richer Soyl; though greater expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be had of the reſult of ſuch a deſign of ſetling in one of theſe Iſlands, as to Profit and Gain, when once come the length of a good Trade.</p>
               <p>But beſides this, <hi>our Countrey People</hi> which will be the <hi>ſtrength of any Collony,</hi> to go from this place, <hi>knows very well how to labour the Ground, for producing all ſorts of Grains, after what faſhion, to breed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all ſorts of Beſtial, in both which, will the great riches of</hi> Jerſey <hi>conſiſt; But it cannot he expected, that they know how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove theſe Iſlands, for</hi> Suggar, Cotton, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, <hi>&amp;c. and this being altogether out of their road, we ſhould thus be altogether deprived of the aſſiſtance we may rationally expect from them, by propoſing to ſettle in a place where the</hi> Nigro Slaves <hi>could do more ſervice, and

There is incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſeveral trades here, in the firſt place Planting, for <hi>Wheat, Indian Corn; Beef, Pork,</hi> &amp;c. give all ready money in <hi>York,</hi> and the Neighbour Collonies; Wheat <hi>4.</hi> ſhillings the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103110:117"/> buſhel, <hi>Indian</hi> Corn <hi>2.</hi> ſs. or half a crown, Pork and Beef, &amp;c. to be had at an ordinary eaſie rate. And in the ſecond place there may be Fiſhing; For the <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> averr they ſwim ſo thick in the Creeks and Rivers, at certain ſeaſons of the year, that they have hailed them out of the waters with their very hand. In the third place for one to have a Malt-houſe, a brew houſe, and a bake-houſe, to make Malt, brew beer, and bake biſkeet for <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and the Neighbour Collonies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding he have a ſhip of his own, and ſkill to manage his buſines, would certainly be a good trad. Laſtly for one to buy up the product of the Countrey, ſuch as all kinds of grains, Beef, Pork, &amp;c. and export them to <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> and import <hi>Rumm</hi> and <hi>Malaſſes,</hi> would certainly be a good trade; as likewiſe change keeping wold be a good trad in <hi>Amboy,</hi> for the higheſt deſigne of the old <hi>Buckskine</hi> Planters (I am juſt now drinking to one of them; our Countrey man who was ſent away by <hi>Cromvel</hi> to <hi>New-England,</hi> a ſlave from <hi>Dumbar,</hi> Living now in <hi>Woodbridge, Like a Scots Laird,</hi> wiſhes his <hi>Countrey men</hi> and <hi>Native Soyle</hi> very well, though he never intends to ſee it.

I ſhall tell you what I would do, were I in your place, if it ſhall fall out you do come, <hi>I</hi> would get ſome truſty Comorads, Merchants to joyn with me, and ſett up a trade in <hi>Perth,</hi> for I think a mans own trade fitts him beſt; if you have <hi>5000.</hi> Merks it is enough, <hi>4.</hi> in goods and one in money, Let none come here deſtitute of money, it is of great requeſt here, and gets chape Penyworths, and <hi>25. per cent</hi> of advantage by it; but I doe not adviſe you, for if you ſhould meet with ſuch trouble and diſopoyntments as we have done by being put by our <hi>Poſt,</hi> you would perhapps be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103110:118"/> &amp; give me the blame; all our baggadg is not yet come from <hi>Maryland,</hi> and I want yet my bed Cloathes, and the Land I intend to ſettle on is not yet purchaſſed from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> for after I have viewed all the <hi>Province</hi> ſuch of it as is yet habitable, I have choſen the <hi>South branch</hi> of <hi>Rariton-River</hi> for conveniency of Fiſhing, Fowling, and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but all the beſt Land lyes back from the Rivers and the Sea Coſts; the further back the better it is, which neceſſitates me to go a mile back. In breif what you heard of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is all true, ſo I need not ſpine out long Diſcriptions of it; no unbyaſſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Perſon will ſpeak ill of the Land, it is both pleaſant and wholeſome, and induſtrous People, after ſome few years Labour, may lead a pleaſant, eaſie Life, and want for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; And I am of opinion, may grow rich too, if they take pains for it, and follow Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſing, and ſome are actaually grown rich ſince they came here, who had nothing before; if any ſhal miſcredit what I have ſaid, I ſhall not think my ſelf baffled for that; but let them live in their opinion and I will live in mine. And if they pleaſe they may do with me as I did with <hi>John Skeens</hi> Wife, caſt my Letters in mine own teeth, and when

I wiſh you were here and your whole Family, for I doubt not but the Countrey would pleaſe you well; For there is abundance of much better Land here then ever <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bikie</hi> was, and an Earldome to be bought far below in pryce the vallow, of what ſuch pettie <hi>Lairdſhipps</hi> as <hi>Arbikie</hi> is ſold for in <hi>Scotland;</hi> without purging of the Lands of any incumbrances; For I
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103110:121"/> hope to winn as much monie this year, as will buy a better Lairdſhip then <hi>Arbikie;</hi> and if ye reſolve not to come over, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to buy Land before I come from this, and title it <hi>Arbikie.</hi> But I ſhall be ſorie to take away your title, for if I do, it will be your own fault; and for your better incouradgement I know you love a Gunn and a Dogge, and here ye will have uſe for both, For Wilde Geeſe, Turkies, Ducks, and Drake, Partridge, Cunies, Doves and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable more kind of Fowls which <hi>I</hi> know not their names, are here to be ſeen every hour of the day, in flocks above Thouſands in Number; And for your Skieft which you uſe to Fiſh with; bring here with you, or one like her, for I aſſure you of good employment, and yet ye may catch more Fiſh in an hour here, than any Fiſher in <hi>Montroſe</hi> in two, excepting Podloes at the ſhore head.</p>
                        <p>Sir, take this as no jeſt from me, for what is here written is a reall truth; but ye may think, it is not my dictating, but the Writter and I have ſet it together the beſt way we can; But yet not ſo

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103110:125"/> GODS miraculous Mercie and Providence; Who immediatly after we had put our ſhip in any mean poſture for plying out her Voyage, was pleaſed to ſend us ſuch a fair and moderate gale of wind, as brought us in ſight of the <hi>Capes</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> within <hi>15.</hi> dayes after or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, having never ceaſed for the whole time, till it brought us thither in ſafty; So we came within the <hi>Capes,</hi> and ſailed up that great Navigable Bay, called <hi>Cheſſapeik bay,</hi> up through all <hi>Virginia</hi> up to <hi>Maryland,</hi> where we landed at the place where our ſhip was bound to take in her Tobacco, for her home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Loadning. But being this Diſabled, and not being able to ply out her Voyage to this place (where ſhe ought to have landed us, we was neceſſitat to travel from thence by Land to this place, being upwards of <hi>200.

But are dayly expecting them by the ſame <hi>Sloup</hi> which we fraghted thither back again.

There are many places upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers yet untaken, and ſome very near this place alſo, which is intended to be the <hi>Metrapolis</hi> of this Province; But it is generally ſandy barren land, and the beſt
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103110:126"/> land is compute by all to be in the woods, back ſome ſeveral miles from the Navigable Rivers; So that we rather chuſe land for profitablneſs, then for Conveniences of Towns, and pleaſure allennarly. For there is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance both of good and barren land in this Province; So that a man may chuſe ſome for pleaſure, and ſome for profit and Conveniency, for I intend to take up about <hi>4.</hi> or <hi>500.</hi> Acres where I have now ſetled; which is on a very pleaſant place and good land, and whereof I have with two hands (not having had time to get many Servants away with me, having come away upon ſo ſhort advertiſement, and whereof I loſt one at <hi>Maryland</hi> by ſickneſs; ſo that now I have but two, and a Woman for dreſſing our Victuals and Cloaths, till I get more ſent me this year) already cleared, or at leaſt will clear; and have in Corn this year about <hi>8,</hi> or <hi>10,</hi> Acres of ground; tho it was prettie thick of ſtately tale Timber, and that ſince the <hi>26.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> at which time, I went to the Woods.

If I deſign to come home, which we can do at good profite. Now for a general deſcription of this Countrey, it is a fine place for thoſe who have a good ſtock, to lay out upon a ſtock of Cattel of all ſorts, which do greatly multiply here in a ſhort time, and are ſold at great rates, and may ſoon increaſe a ſtock greatly; or it is a good Countrey for an Induſtrious Frugal Man, that deſignes to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Husbandries cloſlie; providing he bring but ſome little ſtock to ſtock a Plantation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; or it is very good for Tradſmen, as good Carpenters, Smiths, Tailors, &amp;c. who will get large wages a day. But it is not a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for idle ſluggiſh People; or thoſe who cannot ſome times put too their hands, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Servants. It is a place that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces many fine Fruits, and Phyſick Herbs; The Woods are ſtored with wild Deers, Conies, Woulves, Boars, Racouns, ſome Bavers, and ſeveral other Beaſts, which have fine Furrs. There is alſo abundance of Fowls, and Fiſh, and Water Fowl for the killing. The Timber
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103110:127"/> are moſtly Oak of all ſorts, Walnut, Cheſnut, whereof there are great abundance where I have planted, tho they beſcarce ſo bigg as theſe that comes to <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet large as pleaſant. Strawberries grow very thick upon the ground amongſt the Trees; ſo that ſome places of the Woods are in Summer as it were covered with a red cloath. As I am certainly informed, Fruit Trees advance at a great rate in this place, for a Man may have an Orchard within a few years after the Planting, that may yeeld him a great quantitie of Cydar, which is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their drink in this Province, even amongſt the meaneſt of the Planters; So that this Countrey if well improved, may make a fine place; for Nature has been defficient in nothing to it, either for pleaſure or fruitfulneſs of the Soyl; So that a man being once ſettled two or three years in it, and having Corn, Cattle, and all things neceſſary for the uſe of man within himſelf. And the trouble and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his firſt ſettling by his hand; He may live as Comfortably here as in any place of the World; Providing he could diſpence with the want of his Friends and Relations, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfacti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103110:127"/> cannot but in the next place, much regrate my misfortune, in not ſeeing you, and taking your adviſe before I came to this place; But my Reſolution was ſo ſudden, by the encouragement <hi>I</hi> received from the Chief Governour, and ſome of the Proprietors at <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> and having come in onely to ſee my Siſter with my Brother; and by the many Gentlemen that were going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the ſhip, that I was induced to go along without ſo much as taking my leave of any of my Friends, ſave onely theſe that were then in Town; So that I came of reſolution only to ſee the place, and to ſettle onlie if I fand conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency. And having thus abruptly come away, when I came here, I deſigned not to return till I took ſome tryal of the Countrey, that at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn I might be the more able to give an true accompt thereof. I am not as yet of any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined reſolution as to my ſtaying for altogether as yet; but I reſolved to ſtay this year, till I ſee what the ground produces; and to ſee how my endeavours take effect; and GOD willing, be that time, I may in ſome meaſure be reſolved what to do, for then the greateſt hardſhip will be over my head; and by that time I will have up an prettie good houſe, which is near already framed; whereas hitherto I have dwelt for the moſt part here in a <hi>Wigwam,</hi>

But however <hi>I</hi> may be reſolved hereafter, I intend GOD willing, life and health ſerving to come home a ſtart within this year or two, and ſee all my Friends; and apollogize the beſt manner I can, for my abrupt departure. Now having thus in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſcharged a part of my dutyfull reſpects towards you by this line, in letting you know of my welfare and preſent condition; Earneſtly deſiring ye will favour me with a return by the firſt occaſion; wherein I ſhall be glade to hear of your welfare, of your kind Ladies and Children (To whom and others my neareſt Freinds and Relations, and Comarads, I deſire the favour to be Kindly remembered, begging pardon for this trouble, and your patience to peruſe this, when your leaſure can permit; and afterwards to communicat it to my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, <hi>Calder-hall</hi> and his Lady, or to my Cuſins <hi>Harie Lockhart,</hi> or <hi>George Ersken,</hi> if they call for it; I not having time at preſent to write to them at length, as I have in haſte done to you; I ſhall forbear to give you furder trouble at preſent; intreating you to remember me kindly to your Worthy and Oblidging

Families, ſome civill and Diſcreet, others rude and Malcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the late Purchaſſers. and need ſome thing of auſterity to make them Complaiſant; We have at preſent ſharp froſts, and a good deall of Snow, three dayes of vitrefying froſt, this winter, had not its match for cold theſe 16. years by gone, as the Inhabitants do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us. Againſt this extream we have a good Defence of Fire, and felling of Trees, and might live warm enough, were we not forced to travell for recruit of Proviſions. I reckon the winter to conſiſt only of nights, for the <hi>Suns</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance by day moderateth the cold, and melts the Froſt; I do not find the cold here to cauſe obſtructions or coughs; the Air is ever transſparent; we have ſingular good ſtomachs, which if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as they ſay, it will require a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Countrey when peopled; the water

                        <p>YOur Brother and I did write to you about three Moneths agoe, wherein we told you, that we were 9. weeks at ſea, after we parted from <hi>Killebegs</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> we were all very well; at Sea only we had more Stomachs then meat, to prevent which, if you or any other Commorad come this way, it will be prudence to fortifie themſelves with good Cheeſe, Butter, Bisket, Caks, and Brandie; I believe you are cloyed with deſcriptions of the Countrey; And therefore this in brief, the reports you hear of it are generally true, ſome it may be are <hi>Hyperbolick</hi> in magnifying its Goodneſs, but as many are detractive from what it really deſerves; There is abundance of good Land for the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; Abundance of Swine and Cattle for the raiſing, Deers for killing, houſes for the building: But ſome expect all
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103110:135"/> theſe without pains.

I hope in a little time I ſhall want nothing but the company of the prettie Girls, to all whom, who retain any remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me, Let my ſervice be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, &amp; to all friends; I long exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to hear from you, but more to ſee you; we had many difficulties as our entrance, and in our firſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; But when you come, I hope they ſhall be prevented by,</p>
